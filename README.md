# viRulence_MS

 ## viRulence_MS is a shiny web application that has been made within the CONICET post-doc fellowship of Dr. Martín Ledesma under the direction of Dr. Carlos Vay (Instituto de Fisiopatología y Bioquímica Clínica (INFIBIOC), Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina). This app has been prepared to load raw mass spectra, visualized pre-processed spectra, and retrieve a Positive/Negative toxigenic status prediction for Clostridiodes difficile (CD) mass spectra and resistant/sensitive for Acinetobacter baumannii. 

## This app’s primary purpose is to predict virulence phenotypes in bacteria through a machine learning approach with routinary MALDI-TOF-MS spectra. Up to now, this app includes two models: 

1. the toxigenic status of Clostridiodes difficile strains  
2. the susceptibility status to colistin of Acinetobacter baumannii strains
